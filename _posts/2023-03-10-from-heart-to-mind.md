For the at least the last three years I’ve known that at some point my dormant depression would show its ugly face in full glory at down the road of life. Before that I’ve had spells that were bad, but they näher lasted more than two weeks or so. Two years ago, I suffered a mild heart attack. That changed my outlook on life tremendously. Not only did I stop smoking immediately (something I hadn’t been able to achieve in the previous 30 years) but everything became important, and I do mean *everything*.

Currently in creation … come back later.
