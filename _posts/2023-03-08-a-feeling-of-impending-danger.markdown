Have you ever had that feeling in your stomach, a kind of tightness combined with excited molekules of adrenalin zooming around your intestines, while feeling that your abdomen weighs a ton? That's the state of "impending danger" that have inhabited my body for the last 2-3 weeks at various non-related moments during my days.
