That feeling in your stomach, a tightness in your abdomen, which seems to weigh a ton, while excited molekules of adrenalin play baseball in your intestines - That! That's the state of "impending danger" that have inhabited my lower half for the last 2-3 weeks at various, unspectactular moments.

On a more positive note (because intros should be positive, right?) - Welcome! Join me here, if you like, on journey into the self, past and present, sad and happy, anxious and calm, geeky and fun on occasion, and hopefully is some way meaningful!?
