That feeling in your stomach, a tightness in your abdomen, which seems to weigh a ton, while excited molecules of adrenalin play baseball in your intestines. That! That's the state of "impending danger" that's inhabited my lower half for the last 2-3 weeks at various, unspectacular moments.

On a more positive note (because intros should be positive, right?) - Welcome! Join me here, if you like, on journey to the self, past and present, sad and happy, anxious and calm, geeky and fun on occasion, and hopefully is some way meaningful!?

Being too cowardly to "come out" and say "this is me, this is who I am", my ramblings are anonymous for now. Maybe that'll change as I grow - who knows. I will reveal some things about myself, most will be autobiographical, but some may be fictious.

I have always loved to read "About" pages. It helps me to put what I'm reading into context. It's a bit like when you first meet someone and make that automatic, split-second judgement about who and what they are. Often though, as you get to know them, you'll refine and revise that. Admittedly, we are all more complex than we like to acknowledge.
