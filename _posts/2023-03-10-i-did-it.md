For the at least the last three years I’ve known that at some point my dormant depression would show its ugly face in full glory at down the road of life. Before that I’ve had spells that were bad, but they näher lasted more than two weeks or so. 

Two years ago I suffered a mild heart attack. That changed my outlook on life tremendously.
